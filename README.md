## Overview

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline for processing and [geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding) [CNPJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNPJ)s from the Annual Social Information Report ([RAIS](https://www.rais.gov.br/)) of the Brazilian Ministry of Labor and Employment ([MTE](https://www.gov.br/trabalho-e-emprego)). The pipeline was developed by **Gabriel Caldeira** and **Clara Penz**, with further adaptations by [**Daniel Vartanian**](https://github.com/danielvartan).

The report is available [here](https://cem-usp.github.io/rais-cnpj-geocoding/).

## Data Availability

[![OSF ID](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSF%20ID-p5ufj-1284C5.svg)](https://osf.io/p5ufj/)

The processed data are available in both [`rds`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRDS.html) and [`parquet`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Parquet) formats through a dedicated repository on the Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/)). A metadata file is included alongside the validated datasets.

Because the raw data are not publicly available, only authorized personnel can access the processed files. They are protected with [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) 4096-bit encryption ([OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)) and a 32-byte password to ensure data security.

If you already have access to the OSF repository and the project keys, click [here](https://osf.io/) to access the data. A backup copy of the raw data is also stored on OSF and can be accessed [here](https://osf.io/tdswp/). You can also retrieve these files directly from [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using the [`osfr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osfr/) package.

## Usage

The pipeline was developed using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system and the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). To ensure consistent results, the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package is used to manage and restore the R environment.

Access to the raw data is restricted, as the dataset was obtained upon request and cannot be publicly shared. Running the analyses requires an active internet connection and a set of access keys (see the [*Keys*](#keys) section). Do not use VPNs, corporate proxies, or other network-routing tools while processing the data, as these can interfere with authentication and downloads.

After installing the three dependencies mentioned above and setting all the keys, follow these steps to reproduce the analyses:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open** the project in your preferred IDE.
3. **Restore the R environment** by running [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) in the R console. This will install all required software dependencies.
4. **Open** `index.qmd` and run the code as described in the report.

## Keys

To access the data and run the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) notebook, you must first obtain authorization to access the project's [OSF](https://osf.io) repositories.

Once you have the necessary permissions, create a file named [`.Renviron`](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/set-up.html#:~:text=2.4.6%20The%20.Renviron%20file) in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

- `OSF_PAT`: Your [OSF](https://osf.io/) Personal Access Token ([PAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_access_token)). If you don't have one, go to the settings section of your OSF account and create a new token.
- `ACESSOSAN_PASSWORD`: The password for the project's [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) private key (32 bytes).

Additionally, you will need the following keys in the project's [`_ssh`](_ssh) folder:

- `id_rsa`: The project's private RSA key ([RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) 4096 bits (OpenSSL)).
- `id_rsa.pub`: The project's public RSA key.

These project's keys are provided to authorized personnel only. If you need access, please contact the authors.
